# ATEF - A Social Network
Formally Hackathon2018, I decided to graduate this project to its own repository.  
The original is now frozen and will still be visible from my profile for a while.  

# Description  
This application has no real direction. I am continuing development purly under  
the influence of enjoying slinging some code. I would like to keep this open  
for as long as I can and use it as an educational framework for teaching people  
about programming and web-development.
