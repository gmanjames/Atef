# ATEF - A Social Network
Formally Hackathon2018, I decided to graduate this project to its own repository.  
The original is now frozen and will still be visible from my profile for a while.  

# Description  
This project is largely an exercise in web development. It is simply a social platform  
for basic posting. It would be nice to build a platform that some significant number  
of people use, but that will largely be interest driven. I will try to include guidelines for  
contributing to this repository soon. Having contributors and other interested people  
is really the only way for it to grow I imagine.
